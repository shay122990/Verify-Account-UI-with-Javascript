# Verify Account UI.

## About The Project

You might have seen this if you've signed up for something and you were required to verify your account.
This is a mini project to showcase the verification UI. No function to send the code is applied here.
In this example you have 6 inputs for your code. If you make a mistake you can hit a backspace and change that number.
You can use this UI style for your projects that would require verification or simply check the methods applied for your learning benefit.
